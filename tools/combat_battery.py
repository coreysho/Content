"""Battery for the three things play reported on 2026-09-21, and the two it turned up.

All five were the same shape: CONTENT THAT EXISTS AND CANNOT BE REACHED WITHOUT ENDING THE SESSION.
A weapon with no attack sound, and five finished spells with no row in the table. rs2check rules
19, 21 and 22 are where the general cases live and the selftest proves those go red; what is here
is the part a linter cannot know - the numbers, which came off the wiki on 2026-09-21, and the
autocast arming, which is a three-way agreement between a script, a varbit and an interface.
