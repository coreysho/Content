"""Every mutation must name the check it is written for, and every harness must check that it did.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A mutation harness breaks one thing and requires a checker to go red. Counting
exit codes proves only that SOMETHING noticed - so the harnesses carry a label per mutation naming
the check it was written for, and report "caught by its own check" when a FAIL line contains that
text. That attribution is the whole difference between "a check fired" and "the right check fired".

It had quietly stopped being true in three different ways, and none of them showed up in a run:

  1. 130 of poh_mutate's 266 labels matched no check anywhere - slugs like "hide-needs-a-layer"
     rather than a check's words - so for half that harness "caught by its own check" could never
     print and every one of them read as "caught, but by".
  2. slayer_mutate and maxcape_mutate had no attribution at all. They print red or GREEN from the
     exit code and stop, which is the weaker thing the other harnesses were built to stop doing.
  3. A check's wording was edited and its label left behind, which turns a working mutation into a
     "caught, but by" and looks like an imprecise mutation rather than a stale label.

None of those is visible from a green run, which is why it is a tool. It costs one run of each
checker - about two minutes - against six hours to run the mutations themselves.
