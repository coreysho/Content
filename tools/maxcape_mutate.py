"""Mutation test for tools/maxcape_battery.py.

A check that cannot fail is worse than no check: it reads as coverage and is not. Each entry below
breaks one thing the battery claims to catch - in a throwaway copy of the tree, never in place - and
the battery has to go red. Every mistake here is one that was actually made while building the round,
or one the 377 client or compiler fails quietly on.

The runner is the same one poh_mutate.py uses, copied rather than shared: one tree copy, one mutation
at a time, restore, and the checker named in the entry must exit non-zero. If a third of these
appears the runner is worth lifting into a module of its own.
