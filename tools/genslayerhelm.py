"""Generate every slayer helmet colour from tools/slayerhelmspec.json.

Writes three files and appends to one pack:

  configs/slayer_helm_colours.obj    one obj per colour per imbue state
  configs/slayer_helm.param          the three params the inheritance doors read
  scripts/slayer_helm_colours.rs2    the recolour, and Check/Disassemble for every colour
  pack/obj.pack                      the names, appended in spec order, id-stable

THE ART IS OSRS'S OWN. An earlier version of this generator made a colour by putting two recolour
pairs on the plain helmet's model, which only ever repainted the mask and the strap. OSRS's
variants are separately authored meshes with different horns, spines and, in one case, a hood, so
each colour here names its own imported model set instead. tools/models/importosrs.py did the
importing, from the osrs_obj id in the spec; the generator only points at the result. The camera
is the cache's too - the plain helmet faces 1791 and every recolour 1773.

RECOLOUR PAIRS SURVIVE for the three OSRS itself recolours: Twisted repaints its own model, and
Radiant is a ten-pair repaint of the Oathplate model. Those come out of the cache as HSL16 and are
stored here as the RGB15 a .obj config wants. A source matching no face does nothing at all and
reports no error, so battery group 67 checks every source against the model's real face colours.

WHY A GENERATOR for 28 items: because they differ from each other in a name, five model lines and
a camera, and everything else - the wear positions, the weight, the defences, the equip gate, the
Check and Disassemble ops - has to stay identical to the plain helmet it is a recolour of. That is
exactly the shape that drifts when it is 28 hand-written blocks.

MEMBERSHIP IS THREE PARAMS. slayer_headgear is anything that gives the on-task melee bonus - both
masks and every helmet. slayer_helmet is the four protections a helmet inherits from its parts, so
helmets only: a bare mask has no earmuffs in it. slayer_imbued is the ranged and magic boost. The
three procs that read them are fixed-size no matter how many colours exist.

ONLY THE COLOURS WITH A source BLOCK CAN BE OBTAINED. The rest are built anyway - Corey asked to
be able to look at them with ::give - and they get no head, no unlock and no [opheldu] trigger,
and their Disassemble hands back five parts rather than six. tools/obtainable.py reads this same
spec and lists them by name rather than being silenced.
