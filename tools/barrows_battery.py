"""Battery for the Barrows: the dig in, the climb out, the sarcophagi and the six brothers.

Everything about the Barrows except the scripts was already in the cache and on the maps, and
nothing about it was clickable. That shape is what this battery is built around: the risk here is
not logic, it is ADDRESSING. Six mounds, six crypts, six staircases, six sarcophagi, six brothers
and six bits, all named alike and all easy to cross-wire in a way that compiles, runs, and quietly
sends the player who dug into Torag's mound out of Karil's staircase.

So none of the geometry is trusted from the constants. The mounds are RE-MEASURED off
maps/m55_51.jm2 every run - they are terrain, not locs, because Old School digs into them - and the
crypt tiles are re-measured off maps/m55_151.jm2 against the map's own loc occupancy. The brothers'
numbers are compared against tools/barrowsspec.json, which records Old School's monster infoboxes,
rather than against themselves.
