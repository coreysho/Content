"""Box trapping, live: runs tools/hunter_live.ts inside the engine against the built pack.

    python3 tools/hunter_live_battery.py <engine dir>

Build first (the test reads the packed scripts and maps). The TS file has to sit inside the engine
to resolve its '#/' imports, so it is copied into <engine>/tools for the run and removed after.
Four passes. Box traps at level 70 (four traps, everything must work) and 40 (below the grey
chinchompa's 53, so a trap in their clearing must stay empty - the level gate). Bird snares at 25,
among the tropical wagtails, and at 10, below the wagtail's 19 - the same gate for snares. And the
Hunter skillcape: refused at 50, worn at 99, and its emote and graphic play. And deadfalls on the
northern boulders at 40, and at 30 - below the barb-tailed kebbit's 33, the only prey there. And a
pitfall at 40: spikes, a tease, the jump, a larupia in the pit - with the tease's level gate. And
Feldip weasel tracking at 10: trails from a burrow, every hint checked against the real bearing.
And net traps in each of the four areas - swamp lizards at Canifis (40), orange salamanders at Uzer (50,
and 40, below their 47: nothing comes, and the traps fall over), red at Ourania (60), black in the Bone
Yard (70): every young tree set and dismantled, both geometries sprung and checked, a real catch, the
cap, standing on the net, ownership, the leash, [logout] and Release.
And the desert (hunter_desert.rs2): desert devil tracking at Uzer at 20 - the ground, the gate, trails to a
catch - golden warbler snares at 20 and at 4 (below their 5: nothing comes), and Artimeus's Nardah Hunter Shop.
And the Rellekka grounds at 60, 45 and 8:
the map (spawns, boulders, pits, the trail's nodes and drifts, the ground walkable from the Keldagrim pass,
the plateau's steps both ways), then a polar kebbit trail, both butterflies netted into jars and let out, a
cerulean twitch in a snare, a sabre-toothed kebbit under a deadfall and a kyatt teased into a pit - each
creature's level gate at the lower levels.
And imp catching with magic boxes north-east of Yanille at 75 (and at 65, below the 71 to lay one: the
gate) - bait, a real catch, Retrieve, the imp's respawn, the cap, the leash, [logout] - and the
imp-in-a-box's Talk-to, banking and limits. And Aleck's Hunter Emporium in Yanille: the refit, Aleck
and Leon and their shops, a purchase, the butterfly net, the hunters' crossbow's level and ammunition.
cap, standing on the net, ownership, the leash, [logout] and Release. And the Piscatoris hunter area: its imported
ground (spawns, tracking nodes, the walk in, the fenced enclosure, no dead ops), common and razor-backed kebbit
tracking, copper longtail snares, prickly kebbit deadfalls and chinchompa box traps at 60, 30 and 8 (each gate), and
falconry at 70 and 50 (below the dark and dashing kebbits): Matthias, the glove, a catch of each, a miss, a falcon
left to give up, the stile, and a teleport out."""
