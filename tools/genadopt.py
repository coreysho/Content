"""Adopt a panel out of the 377 cache: rename it, name its components, move it, repack it.

WHY THIS IS A TOOL AND NOT A HAND EDIT. scripts/interfaces/ holds 280 interfaces straight out of
the cache. 213 still carry their cache id and every component in them is com_<n>, so a script that
used one would read `if_settext(inter_53:com_21, ...)` and nobody, including whoever wrote it,
could say what com_21 was. Adopting one means renaming the interface and its components and
re-taking every id in pack/interface.pack and pack/interface.order. That was done by hand once
(tools/genancientbook.py, for inter_267) and this round needed it six more times, which is the
moment it stops being a hand edit.

THE NAMES COME FROM THE PANEL'S OWN TEXT. A rule in tools/adoptspec.json matches components on one
field and a regex, and the regex's named groups feed the name template - so the smelt window's 32
buttons are named from what each button SAYS ("Smelt 1 @lre@Silver" -> smelt_1_silver), not from a
list somebody typed. That matters for one specific reason: the panel's column order is Bronze,
Iron, SILVER, STEEL, Gold... and smelting.struct lists the bars Bronze, Iron, STEEL, SILVER, Gold.
A hand-written list would have swapped two columns and nothing would have noticed.

`expect` on each rule is the count that must match. A panel that is not the one the spec thinks it
is fails the count rather than quietly renaming the wrong components.

WHAT IS NOT RENAMED. Anything no rule matches keeps its com_<n>. Nothing else names those, and a
name nobody uses is a name that goes stale.

THE FILE IS REWRITTEN LINE BY LINE. Only block headers, the `layer=`/`overlayer=` references that
follow a rename, and an added header comment change. Everything else - every coordinate, colour,
graphic, script operand - is copied through byte for byte, which is what makes "154 components
there, 154 here" a meaningful sentence in a battery rather than a coincidence.
