"""Decode the PACKED obj table and answer questions about it, not about the configs.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Twice now a claim about how an item behaves has been wrong because it was reasoned
from the .obj configs rather than read from the artefact the server actually loads. The worst was
the notes round: a whole engine patch was written, built and discarded because tools/pack already
derived the forward certificate link, and nothing had ever loaded the packed data to look.

The configs are source. data/pack/server/obj.dat is the artefact. A rule about the artefact has to
be checked against the artefact.

HOW IT SELF-VALIDATES. The server stream is one count followed by every obj's opcodes terminated
by a 0, so there are no offsets to resync on: a single mis-sized read desynchronises everything
after it. That means the decode cannot be subtly wrong and still produce 8,000 debugnames that
match pack/obj.pack - so the name check below is not a nicety, it is the proof that every other
number this prints came off the right bytes. It is checked first and nothing else is reported if
it fails.

Needs a build to have run: it reads ../engine/data/pack/server/obj.dat.
