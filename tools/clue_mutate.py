"""Mutation test for tools/clue_battery.py.

A check that cannot fail is worse than no check: it reads as coverage and is not. Each entry breaks
one thing the battery claims to catch - in a throwaway copy of the tree, never in place - and the
battery has to go red, with the check named in the entry among the ones that fired.

THIS HARNESS HAS THE ANCHOR UNIQUENESS RULE, which tools/follower_mutate.py and
tools/gamemode_mutate.py have and the five older ones do not. A find string matching more than once
is a mutation that changes something other than what it names - four of them did exactly that in
one round of the pet work, silently - so a non-unique pattern is a SKIP and a failure here rather
than a quiet first-match replace.
