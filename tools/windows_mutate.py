"""Break the four-windows round on purpose, one thing at a time, and check that the check that
goes red is the one that is supposed to.

THE RULES THIS HARNESS FOLLOWS, all of them paid for by an earlier round:

  - COUNTING EXIT CODES IS NOT MUTATION TESTING. A mutation that trips some other check is not
    caught; it is a coincidence. Every entry names the check it expects and the run reports which
    check actually fired.
  - A MUTATION NEEDS AN ANCHOR UNIQUE TO THE THING IT IS MUTATING. str.replace takes the first
    match, so an anchor that appears twice breaks the wrong one and the real check stays green.
    Every anchor is asserted unique before it is applied.
  - A LABEL IS THE CHECK'S WORDING, NOT THE MUTATION'S. tools/mutate_labels.py audits that.
