"""Battery for the bigger bank and the tool leprechaun's store.

Two things in one round because they are the same thing twice: a store that outgrew the shape it
was kept in. The bank outgrew a 5000-byte packet buffer and the leprechaun outgrew three bits per
tool. So group 1-4 are the bank and group 5-9 are the leprechaun.

WHAT THIS CHECKS THAT NOTHING ELSE DOES. tools/leprechaun_sim.py models the BEHAVIOUR (conservation,
caps, placeholders) and engine/tools/invfullcheck.ts runs the real encoder against the real packed
configs. This checks the things neither can see: that the numbers are OSRS's rather than convenient
(tools/leprechaunspec.json, written from the wiki before any of it was built), that the interface
and the packs agree, that the dialogue reaches the new window and the old store is gone, and that
the engine and client halves of the bank change are both actually there - the client is a separate
repo, so the only thing this can check about it is the source, which is exactly the thing that
silently does not get changed.
