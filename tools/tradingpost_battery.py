"""Battery for the Trading Post - the windows, the script that drives them, and the post itself.

The market's own rules - escrow, refunds, nothing created or destroyed - are checked in the engine,
by engine/tools/tradingpostcheck.ts, against the real TradingPost class and a real SQLite. What is
left for this side is the part only content can get wrong, and every bug available here is a
silent one:

  THE BARTER INV HOLDS REAL ITEMS. It must be handed back whatever closes its window, and the
  only place that can happen is [if_close,tradingpost_offer].
  EVERY tp_ ACTION ANSWERS. Each returns '' or a line to show; a call whose answer is thrown away
  is a trade that failed while the player was told nothing.
  THREE CLICKS CANNOT BE UNDONE. Buy now, Accept and Take down each arm %tp_confirm on the first
  click and act on the second - and nothing else may call the action they guard.
  EVERY BUTTON IS WIRED, and every component the script names exists in a window.
  THE POST IS WHERE IT SAYS: the loc, its pack id, its model, and Edgeville's map line agree.
