"""Mutation test for tools/slayer_battery.py.

Each entry breaks one thing the battery claims to catch - in a throwaway copy, never in place - and
the battery has to go red. Same runner as poh_mutate.py and maxcape_mutate.py, copied a third time;
that is now three, so the next one should lift it into a module instead.
