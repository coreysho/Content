"""Battery for the Max cape, the Construction cape and the elder chaos druid robes.

Everything here is PARSED OUT of the delivered files - the item bonuses from the .obj configs, the
requirement and the price from the scripts that compute them, the spawns from the real maps, the
drop rates from the drop table's own arithmetic - so a change to one of them cannot pass a check
still asserting the old value. The numbers on the right-hand side of a comparison are OSRS's, from
oldschool.runescape.wiki (Max_cape, Max_hood, Elder_chaos_druid and the three robe pages).
