"""Battery for the rune pouch.

The feature is not "an item that holds runes" - it is "every spell in the game now looks in two
places". So most of what is checked here is the NEGATIVE: that no rune read and no rune spend
anywhere in the magic path still looks only in the inventory. One missed site is a spell that says
you have no runes while the pouch is full.
