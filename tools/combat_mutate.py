"""Mutation test for tools/combat_battery.py and for rs2check's rules 19, 21 and 22.

Every entry breaks one of the 2026-09-21 play fixes and expects the named check to go red. Entries
whose name ends in (rs2check) are run against tools/rs2check.py instead of the battery, because the
general case of each bug lives in a rule rather than in a check here.

    python3 tools/combat_mutate.py              # all of them
    python3 tools/combat_mutate.py "autocast"   # just the ones whose name contains that
