"""Battery for the clue hunter outfit and the three things it does.

Everything is PARSED OUT of the delivered files - the bonuses from the obj config, the effects from
the scripts that hold them, the roll counts from the three reward procs - so a change to one of
them cannot pass a check still asserting the old value. The numbers on the right-hand side are the
OSRS item table's, through tools/cluehunterspec.json, except the three Corey chose, which the spec
marks as departures.
