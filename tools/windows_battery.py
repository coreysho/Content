"""Checks for the four cache windows: smelting, tanning, silver casting and the churn.

WHAT THIS HAS TO ANCHOR AGAINST, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE CACHE FILE. The ancient-spellbook round
could check its generated panel against scripts/interfaces/inter_267.if, because that file stayed
in the tree as the generator's input. These six panels were ADOPTED instead - renamed and moved -
so the cache file is gone, and a check that reads only the adopted file would be checking the
generator against itself.

So every group below anchors on something this round did not write:

  - the 377 loc configs, which say op2=Smelt on seven furnaces and op1=Churn on two dairy churns
  - the 377 npc config, which says op3=Trade on Ellis
  - scripts/_unpack/727/all.inv, which carries Jagex's own seven silvercast_* inventories, one per
    slot of the Silver Casting panel, each stocking the product that slot shows
  - smelting.struct, which has the level, the ores and the experience for all eight bars
  - tanner.constant, which has both tanners' prices
