"""Generate the whole furniture layer from tools/furnspec.json.

WRITES
  scripts/skill_construction/configs/poh_furniture.enum   the six item tables + the family names
  scripts/skill_construction/configs/construction.varp    the ^poh_furn_slots storage varps
  scripts/skill_construction/configs/construction.constant  the ^poh_fam_* block and the counts
  pack/varp.pack                                          ids for any varp that is new
  scripts/skill_construction/scripts/poh_furniture.rs2     all of it

WHY GENERATED. 238 pieces means a 238-case switch for the loc, another for the model, 238 removal
triggers and six enum tables of 238 rows, all of which have to agree with each other and with the
hotspot list. Twelve families were hand-checkable; fifty-one are not.

THE RULES, all in one place because they are the tunable part and not cache data:
  wood    the loc's own name when it says one (Oak bench, Gilded wardrobe -> mahogany), otherwise
          split positionally across the family's tiers
  level   family base + 7 per wood step + 3 per tier within that wood
  planks  one count per family, the same at every tier, as OSRS mostly does
  xp      planks x the per-plank value in construction.constant - not a table at all

WHAT IT CHECKS BEFORE WRITING ANYTHING (it refuses rather than emitting something that will not
compile or will not work):
  - every loc exists in poh.loc, carries op5=Remove, and is used by exactly one family
  - every hotspot id exists, is category=poh_hotspot, and carries the shape the family declares -
    a wrong shape puts loc_add on a different LAYER and the hotspot is not replaced, so you get the
    furniture AND the hotspot standing in the same tile
  - no hotspot is a door hotspot, and no hotspot is claimed twice
  - every item number fits the 8-bit item field
  - the labels inside a family are distinct, because a menu with two identical rows is a coin toss

// {items}-case switch for the loc, another for the model, {items} removal triggers and six enum tables of
// {items} rows, all of which have to agree with each other and with the {hots} hotspot triggers. Twelve
// families were hand-checkable; fifty-one are not. Edit the spec, not this file.
//
// WHERE IT LIVES. {slots} perm varps, one piece each, packed into {bits} bits - the room cell (3+3), the
// tile inside that room (3+3), the angle (2) and which of the {items} buildable things it is (8+7). The
// tile inside the zone is what identifies the hotspot, and it is exactly what loc_coord gives, so
// nothing has to enumerate hotspots or number them. Same trick as the room grid: the save writes
// varps sparsely by id, so an unfurnished house costs nothing. No engine change, no save bump.
//
// HOW IT APPEARS. loc_add at the hotspot's own coord and angle. World.changeLoc swaps the type in
// place, so the hotspot BECOMES the furniture - and it then survives instance_loccategory(...,
// poh_hotspot, false), because that only removes locs whose TYPE's category is poh_hotspot, which
// the furniture's is not. ~poh_build places furniture after the zone loop and before the hide.
//
// TAKING IT BACK OUT re-lays the whole zone rather than trying to put the hotspot back. The template
// is the exact truth about what was there; reconstructing it from a family id would be a guess, and
// several of these families have more than one hotspot loc.
//
// THE SHAPE IS NOT STORED. Every piece of a family is placed with one shape, a literal in the switch
// below, so it can only ever be placed as the shape its own hotspot carries - correct by
// construction rather than by bookkeeping. genfurn.py checks each family's shape against the six
// style squares and refuses to emit a family whose shape would land on a different LAYER from its
// hotspot, because then the hotspot would not be replaced and both would stand in the same tile.
