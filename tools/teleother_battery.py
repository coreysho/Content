"""Battery for Teleother - the three spells, the panel, and the Accept aid setting they read.

Three different things get checked here, and they are separate on purpose.

THE NUMBERS. The nine rune counts and three levels in magic_spell_table were not typed from a
wiki: every one of them is derivable from the CACHE's own button in magic.if, which has been
greying these three spells correctly since the unpack. So this battery re-derives all twelve from
the button scripts and compares. The two sides came from different places and neither was copied
from the other, which is the only kind of agreement worth checking.

THE PANEL. scripts/skill_magic/interfaces/teleother.if is inter_251.if renamed in place - Jagex's
own "Teleport Option" screen. Four component blocks were renamed and NOTHING ELSE was touched, so
the checks here are that the cache's own strings are all still in it, that the ids in
interface.pack were kept rather than re-taken, and that no component was lost on the way.

THE FLOW. Ordering, mostly, because the bugs available here are all silent ones: a cost paid
before a check that can still refuse, a close handler that wipes the offer out from under the
accept still reading it, a p_ op in an if_button that has no p_active_player.
