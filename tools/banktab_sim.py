"""Re-implement the bank tab arithmetic from bank_tabs.rs2 and beat on it.

WHY. A tab is a RANGE of one ordered list, so every count is load-bearing: get one wrong and
every tab above it shows somebody else's items. Nothing in the build checks that, and it is not
the kind of thing that shows up as a crash - it shows up as a player's bank quietly reshuffling.
So the procs are transcribed here and run against random sequences, asserting the invariants the
rs2 cannot assert for itself.

Transcribed from scripts/interface_bank/scripts/bank_tabs.rs2 - if that changes, change this.
