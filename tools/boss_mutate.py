"""Mutation test for tools/boss_battery.py.

A check that cannot fail is worse than no check. Each entry breaks one thing the battery claims to
catch - in a throwaway copy, never in place - and the battery has to go red with the named check
among the ones that fired.

HAS THE ANCHOR UNIQUENESS RULE. A find string matching twice changes something other than what it
names while still coming back red, which looks like coverage and is not.
